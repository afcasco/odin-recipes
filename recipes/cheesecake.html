    <h2>The Perfect Cheesecake Recipe</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (128g) graham cracker crumbs, 9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>5 1/3 tablespoons (74g) butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (152g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanill extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the
            oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than
            on the sides.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs
            and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at
            low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven,
            and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.
        </li>
        <li>To bake the cheesecake: Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield;
            or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30
            minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and
            170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it,
            covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired. </li>
        <li>Storage information: Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage.
        </li>
    </ol>
